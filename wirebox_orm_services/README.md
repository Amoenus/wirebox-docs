# WireBox ORM Services

WireBox includes all of our ORM services to enable you to work with ColdFusion ORM in a much more efficient manner without using ColdBox. Here are the main integrations we offer for ORM services:

* [Base ORM Services ](http://wiki.coldbox.org/wiki/ORM:BaseORMService.cfm): Our base class that enables you to work with ORM entities.
* [Active Entity](http://wiki.coldbox.org/wiki/ORM:ActiveEntity.cfm) : Follows a similar Active Record pattern to ORM entities.
* [Virtual Entity Services](http://wiki.coldbox.org/wiki/ORM:VirtualEntityService.cfm) : Create virtual service layers for specific ORM entities for you.
* [Criteria Builder](http://wiki.coldbox.org/wiki/ORM:CriteriaBuilder.cfm) : Tap into the power of Hibernate Criteria Queries with our Criteria Builder
* [Detached Criteria Builder](http://wiki.coldbox.org/wiki/ORM:DetachedCriteriaBuilder.cfm) : With the new Detached Criteria Builder, you can expand the power and flexibility of your criteria queries with support for criteria and projection subqueries, all while using the same intuitive patterns of Criteria Builder
* [ ORM Entity Injection](http://wiki.coldbox.org/wiki/WireBox-EntityInjection.cfm) : Use WireBox for applying dependency injection & AOP to ORM entities. Also use it as a way to proxy hibernate listeners
