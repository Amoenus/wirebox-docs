# ORM Entity Injection
WireBox is fully capable to do ORM entity injection in your ColdFusion applications in two approaches:

* [ColdBox ORM Module](https://github.com/coldbox/cbox-cborm) - for use in ColdBox applications
* [Standalone WireBox ](http://wiki.coldbox.org/wiki/WireBox-EntityInjection.cfm)- for use in ColdBox or any framework or any ColdFusion application.
